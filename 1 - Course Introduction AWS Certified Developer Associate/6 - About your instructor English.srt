00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,890
‫Hi, and welcome.

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:03,130
‫{\an8}My name is Stephane Maarek,

3
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:05,540
‫{\an8}and I will be your instructor for this course.

4
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,110
‫I'm delighted to have you here.

5
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,030
‫I really hope that you enjoy this course

6
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:11,550
‫and that you will go all the way through with it.

7
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,520
‫This is just a two minutes introduction

8
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,810
‫so that you get to know me.

9
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:17,050
‫And then we'll hop it right into the course.

10
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,950
‫I'm French, so if you hear a small accent,

11
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:21,140
‫this is where it comes from.

12
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,920
‫The sweet country of France.

13
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,010
‫But I've also lived in the United States,

14
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:28,180
‫in Australia, in Mexico, and now in Portugal.

15
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:31,457
‫My expertise is going to be around AWS certifications

16
00:00:31,457 --> 00:00:33,190
‫and Apache Kafka.

17
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:34,023
‫Why?

18
00:00:34,023 --> 00:00:35,670
‫Well, because in my career, I've had the chance

19
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,720
‫to be a data analyst, a big data engineer, a developer,

20
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,230
‫and an AWS solutions architect.

21
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:45,240
‫And obviously, well, (chuckles) today, I'm a teacher.

22
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,540
‫I love to teach, and this is my passion.

23
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,220
‫And I wanna help you achieve any goal you have

24
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,600
‫through online learning.

25
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,130
‫Before we get started with this course,

26
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,300
‫there are two ways you can connect with me.

27
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,110
‫First place is on LinkedIn,

28
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:59,850
‫{\an8}this is where I will share more professional updates,

29
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,920
‫{\an8}such as news on the AWS and the Kafka ecosystem,

30
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,570
‫{\an8}course releases, and most importantly,

31
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:07,970
‫{\an8}where I will congratulate you

32
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:10,410
‫{\an8}if you tag me on your course certificates.

33
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:12,810
‫{\an8}So for example, if you just completed the course

34
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,250
‫{\an8}or passed a certification, make a post and mention me.

35
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,390
‫{\an8}And I will make sure to congratulate you.

36
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,460
‫I love to see my students reach their goals,

37
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,290
‫this is my main motivation.

38
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,440
‫The second way is on Instagram.

39
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,480
‫{\an8}Instagram is a big project of mine

40
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,770
‫{\an8}that I started over two years ago.

41
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:30,410
‫{\an8}I love to travel the world

42
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:33,150
‫{\an8}and I decided to meet students along the way.

43
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,560
‫{\an8}Every time I go to a new destination,

44
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,580
‫{\an8}I'll make a post and I will try to meet students.

45
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:42,010
‫{\an8}And to date, I've already met over 25 students.

46
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:44,140
‫{\an8}Anytime, I meet with students, we'll have a chat

47
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,870
‫{\an8}about your goals, how the course helps you,

48
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:49,800
‫{\an8}your achievements, your career, and then at the end,

49
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,290
‫{\an8}I will make a post about it.

50
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:53,014
‫{\an8}So if you wanna get a chance to meet me

51
00:01:53,014 --> 00:01:55,140
‫{\an8}or read about other students' story

52
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,960
‫{\an8}or get more personal behind the scenes updates,

53
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,700
‫then follow me on Instagram.

54
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,740
‫Finally, before starting this course,

55
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,740
‫I want you to set a goal.

56
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:06,400
‫By setting a goal, you will have a much higher chance

57
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,950
‫of finishing this course and learning a lot.

58
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:10,270
‫So maybe you wanna finish your course

59
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:12,530
‫in three weeks, that's perfect.

60
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:15,400
‫Take a piece of paper and a pen, write your goal on it,

61
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,870
‫and then stick with it.

62
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:17,860
‫This is how you learn

63
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,440
‫and this is how you'll make the most out of this course.

64
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,260
‫And don't hesitate to go through the lectures

65
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,780
‫as many times as needed.

66
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,850
‫This is what video is used for.

67
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:28,460
‫If necessary, you can speed up or slow down

68
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,530
‫the playback speed so it becomes easier

69
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:32,160
‫for you to understand me.

70
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,370
‫So that's it for me.

71
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:34,940
‫I hope you will enjoy this course.

72
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,400
‫And I will see you in the next lecture.

73
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,237
‫Happy learning.

74
00:02:38,237 --> 00:02:40,904
‫{\an8}(upbeat music)
