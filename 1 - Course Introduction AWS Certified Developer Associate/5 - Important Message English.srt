1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,870
‫So just a quick lecture about course review. Very shortly

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:08,370
‫Udemy will ask you to give your opinion about this course and ask that you put a star rating. The star rating

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,690
‫represents the entire course overall not just if you like what you've just seen

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,240
‫So basically these reviews, they mean a lot to me.

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,080
‫And they represent your opinion about the course. They're super important and I would love one from you

6
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:20,520
‫but if you're not ready to rate the course.

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,520
‫Just click on "ask me later" and the prompt will come back maybe half an hour or an hour later.

8
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:28,130
‫Overall in this course we're going to start by the fundamentals.

9
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:33,300
‫And so if you're already a certified solutions architect you can skip the few fundamental lectures or sections

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,810
‫or you can just watch them if you want a quick refresher.

11
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:36,450
‫OK.

12
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,240
‫I really hope you'll enjoy this course.

13
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,700
‫I will see you in the next lecture.
