00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,269
‫Hello, and welcome to the

2
00:00:01,269 --> 00:00:03,750
‫AWS Certified Developer Associate Course.

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,720
‫My name is Stephane Maarek, and I will be your instructor.

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,070
‫So we're starting in five minutes.

5
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:10,230
‫Let's just go over some prerequisites.

6
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,860
‫So we're going to prepare for the DVA-C02 certification,

7
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,660
‫and although it's a challenging certification,

8
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,720
‫I will try to make this course as interesting as possible

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,970
‫to cover everything you need to know.

10
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:24,720
‫And as such, we will cover over 30 AWS services.

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,670
‫So we have a lot to learn, but don't worry,

12
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,140
‫we'll go step by step.

13
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,290
‫Even if you're an IT or an AWS beginner, you're welcome,

14
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:33,120
‫but take your time, this is not a race,

15
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,730
‫and haggle with me with the hands-on.

16
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,640
‫You don't need to be a developer to pass the developer exam,

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,040
‫but it definitely helps to have some coding background.

18
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,620
‫Now, if this is your second AWS certification

19
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:44,453
‫and you've done the

20
00:00:44,453 --> 00:00:46,350
‫Certified Solutions Architect beforehand,

21
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:47,910
‫try not to skip any lectures.

22
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,340
‫After the seventh section, yes, there are some new content

23
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,140
‫regarding the Certified Developer exam,

24
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,000
‫but please review the first lectures.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,010
‫It will be always good for you

26
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,170
‫to rehash that basic knowledge.

27
00:00:58,170 --> 00:00:59,490
‫Okay, so what about me?

28
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:01,200
‫So I've passed the certification twice,

29
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:06,200
‫so once in 2018, and I scored with 984, so only one mistake,

30
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,070
‫and then, very recently, in April 16th, 2020,

31
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,900
‫I've scored again 982.

32
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,240
‫I wanted to make sure that this course was up to date,

33
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,290
‫and trust me, it is.

34
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:19,050
‫I've updated all the lectures that needed to be updated

35
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:22,650
‫to pass the exam with flying colors in 2020.

36
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:23,640
‫So what's AWS?

37
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,710
‫If you're new to this, this is a cloud provider,

38
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:29,640
‫and with the AWS, you're able to have services and servers

39
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,580
‫that can be used on demand and scales very easily.

40
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,230
‫This has allowed companies

41
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,660
‫to run a website for, say, millions of people,

42
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,930
‫with only three or five engineers, which is crazy.

43
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:42,420
‫So AWS has revolutionized IT over time,

44
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,640
‫and now it powers some of the biggest websites in the world

45
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,930
‫that you know of, for example,

46
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:49,470
‫obviously Amazon.com, but also Netflix.

47
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,360
‫So this course is very complete.

48
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,760
‫We'll be learning all of these things and more,

49
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,100
‫and this may be daunting at first, but don't worry,

50
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,210
‫we'll go step by step.

51
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,350
‫Don't feel afraid.

52
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,370
‫But as you can tell,

53
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:02,370
‫there's a lot of things we have to learn in this course.

54
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,590
‫So I like to call AWS a spaghetti bowl

55
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,240
‫because it is a complete mess,

56
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,060
‫but we'll try together to navigate through it

57
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,880
‫and together learn all the services we need

58
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,430
‫for you to become an AWS certified developer.

59
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,900
‫So thank you so much for watching,

60
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,850
‫and I will see you in the next lecture.
